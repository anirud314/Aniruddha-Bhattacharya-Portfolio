Project done by Aniruddha Bhattacharya for UC Berkeley Extension coding bootcamp

## Detailed Documentation on project.
8-23-2021:
I haven't submitted this assignment mainly due to working on other assignments and initially skipping it, But I did have to do most of it in order to properly submit the projects. As it is the project meets most if not all of the criteria that I remember for submission so I might as well submit it.

ERR - 
The only error that I can think of is the fact that the bio block is not working the way I want it to. I think the solution would be to change the bio block into a display: flex. But due to a lack of time and the fact I have to submit more assignments I have decided to move on from this Assignment.
